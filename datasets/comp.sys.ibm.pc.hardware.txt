Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed
circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your
IDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in
the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle
is center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide
positioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:
look into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On
all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin
is pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard
for the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins
39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep
the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the
cable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the
pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But
beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables
with pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors
this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide
which side is pin 1.

It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives
are jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you
should be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the
drive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper
selects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the 
docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,
then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have
one.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like
yourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't
have convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice
help.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be
able to help you).

I think you mean the ethernet numbers.  The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.
This is a "physical layer" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.
The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or
I) physical identification scheme (number).

But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the
manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a
reason to ever do that.

If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly
changable.  But it is strictly software.

Yep.  I've done this, too.  The trick is to use a tiny screwdriver and push
down on the "latch" of each pin and then pull it out of the connector.  Label
each one first with tape so you don't get them confused after you've pulled
them out.  Compare the pinout tables in the Mitsumi and Soundblaster manuals
to get the correct orientation.

Hello,

I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ, but couldn't
find the answer. Anyway...

The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best
keyboard around. Function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click,
etc. Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone?

I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality. I.e. the
typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. It seams to me that the pins &
electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same. 
Maybe the communication protocol is different? 

Please answer by e-mail. Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible.
In that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology.

Thanks,

Duco

Think!

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to.

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to
start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.

 A few weeks ago I saw an ad in the German magazine c't
about a so-called Videostreamer. This is an interface
between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for
backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?)
claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape.
                         ^^^^^^^^^^

It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200, I think)

My question is:
 Does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes 
 REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite
 unbelievable to me). 

However, any comments on the interface are appreciated.

Well, I tried this method based on responses from several people.  Either
I am a klutz(probable) or they have changed the connector.  I ended up having
to destroy the connector, put heat shrink tubing on the individual pins and 
then plug them into the SB connector in the correct order.  It works great 
this way so this turned out just fine.  It certainly sounded easy based on
other people's experiences but my attempts did not go too well...

You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error
Checking enabled or disabled.  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error
when it's enabled, and not when it's disabled.  How high will the count go on
the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  Does the system beep
at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  The error could be occuring in
Cache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms.

The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board
manufacturer either.  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies
(among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some
simm sockets to make your board.  I tend to doubt your problem is with your
IDE controller, also.

Anyway, perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better.

It first depends on what an idle cpu is doing!

I'm not sure about DOS, but many multitasking OSs have an loop like this


loop:
	is there anything to do?
		YES -> do it; goto loop
		NO  -> goto loop


The CPU is not doing any work but it is still processing instructions...

   I used to have a lot of line noise problems with my 1200 baud modem.
What was sudgested to me was to put a toriod transformer on the line.
This is easily done by getting a large toroid core from your local
electronics shop, a toroid core is a ceramic/metal "donut", and wind the
telephone line in through the center of the core and out around the
ouTside five or six times. This is a easy and cheap fix that does not
have the hassels of having to use sofware to fix a hardware problem.

IDE drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave.
If it is a master, then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present.
These must be set correctly according to each drive's manufacturers spec-
ification.  The CMOS setup is almost positively NOT the problem.  It is
probably not the controller - IDE controllers all support exactly two
drives maximum.  Check those jumpers.

I've done some ASIC and digital design, but not any CPU design.
It would seem to me that on a 486, the FPU is not being used, most of
the cache is not being accessed, the off chip buffers/drivers are idle,
the multiplier isn't multiplying, the barrel shifters aren't shifting,
microcode isn't microcoding, etc.  This means transistors aren't
switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS), which means
less heat.\

From what I understand, the Pentium shuts down those sections of the
CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power.

I would like to know as well, since I just bought a 200MB Seagate IDE
drive and want to add it to my computer (a four-year-old Gateway
386/20), which currently has an 80MB Seagate SCSI drive.  The SCSI

and apparently the SCSI controller works its wonders.  I wondering if

Same here.

Any help would be appreciated, since I intend to install this drive
ASAP; I'd like to know what to do (and what not to do) before I start.

GCC and other big programs seemed to crash about 15% of the time for me.
gcc gave something like "program as got fatal signal 11" and when doing
anything past the complexity of elvis, kermit, etc, I got kernel general
protection faults at *least* once a session.

I disabled my cache as suggested, and bingo, Linux is as stable as a rock

Does any one know why the cache would do something like this?

1. do not do a low level format on an IDE drive unless you have the

   available from bbs's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal
   fee.

2. In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also
   another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present.  Get it right!

3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to
   pin 1.  No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable.  Be sure of pin 1
   on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok
   but assumptions are bad).

4. If the cable and jumpers are correct, and the CMOS setup is correct,
   then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format.

How difficult is it to modify a 386DX/40 motherboard to run at

This is a fundamental aspect of Novell's business; they wouldn't be
where they are if they didn't live up to their "Novell Does Printing"
slogan.  We run 6 printers of varying types off our Novell network;
I'm sure there are places with hundreds.

RTFM on the CAPTURE command, PRINTCON, PSERVER, and the sections of
the Windows 3.1 manual which cover network printing.  If you haven't bought
Novell's products yet, rephrase your question and look for information about
how *well* various competitors do printing.

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery 
maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try 
replacing the battery.

If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave
your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor 
charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.

It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is 
corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and
check out your system.

a 286 upgrade would probably cost about $50, 386 about $150 or so.  
Coprocessors or accelerator cards would cost at least that much.

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2
IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and 
1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also have
a Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC 
before.  As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.
However, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has to
be the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other 
controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI).
just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it.
Then, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to 
ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you 
have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so
on.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it.
Good Luck!

I ran into the same problem when I upgraded from a 2400 modem to a 14400
modem. Any time I give the modem a reset command [ATZ] while, in windows.
The computer locks up. If I give the ATZ command in DOS, it will work. My solution 
was to not give the modem the [ATZ] command thru windows. In the PROCOMM +
install process I told the program I have a hayes compatible 2400 modem. ATZ
was not included in the initialization string & it works fine. I called MS
about this, & they didn't have a clue as to what the memory/interupt conflict 
could be. The lockup accures using ANY windows comm program that gives the ATZ
command.

486DX2/66 is faster for this if you are using DOS. PC Mag reviewed a bunch
of 486DX2/66 and a 486DX50 and the486DX2/66 was faster...

1) It fixes some problems with MicroProse games.  After leaving F-15 III it
would, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive A:.  This has been fixed.  I
don't know what other corrections were made.

2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work.

3) Download glb05.exe.  Format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a
config.sys or autoexec.bat.  Run the self extracting archive so all the files
explode to the disk.  Run the file fsh.exe.  It should be self-explanatory from
there.

doesn't recognize that I have changed floppies. If I do a "DIR", I see

that

worked
well with my equipment. I have Superstor Pro, and DESQVIEW/X ( with

I need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks (3.5") and ideally would like to

[Yes, I know that services to do this exist.] 

I know that standard ISA bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active
at a time. I know that some controllers are available that can handle 4 
floppies with serialized access. I know that microchannel machines can keep 
more than one floppy active simultaneously. But does anyone have a controller 
for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going?
How about for an EISA machine?

If the limitation is a software limitation, I can work around that by using
OS/2 1.3 on my PC-286.

I ran into this about six months ago.  My system is a GW2000 486DX/66V,
8 megs RAM, 1Meg ATI GUP VLB. It seems the problem is that the ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro card consumes the COM4 port for some reason, so only

    MODEL   PCBA   E-P   TDA
     AXX    01A    29A
Can I replace the MFM interface by the SCSI interface and use the drive
as a SCSI drive? What would the drive size be? There is a set of jumpers
on the SCSI interface with "6SEL" besides it. What is the use of it?

Could someone also send me specs for Seagate ST4096 (5" full-height) drive?

: Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)

I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation
for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-
modem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't
really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial
I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,
but you should still check your software!

I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is
a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a
modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications
hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA
Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the
connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is
a "DB-25" but IBM has set an alternative "standard" of DB-9.  The primary
signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).
There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.
For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate
in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an
output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that
it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)
signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's
five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)
signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used
to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok
via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input
to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)
are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs
to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -
a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection
to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.
DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the "connection" has been established
i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh
there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have
explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:

Name    DB-9     DB-25
 SG       5        7
 TD       3        2
 RD       2        3
DTR       4       20
DSR       6        6
DCD       1        8
RTS       7        4
CTS       8        5
 RI       9       22

Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE
to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232
signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert
the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these
signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If
this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,
and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other
end, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send
data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just
send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would
include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the
software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-
ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the
serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to
be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-
Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The
only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also
fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And
that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for
flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the
DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the
DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast
to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by
asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can
send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow
control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,
one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no
wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF
commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware
flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because
your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol
signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract "escape"
codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-
ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to
do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods
is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair
game.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.
But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with
all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,
I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control
the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the
clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a
differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling
stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS
signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-
ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the
RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other
possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain
signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would
mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting
the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like
this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more
"gotcha" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to
see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the
DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but
the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And
of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must
pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,
if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not
specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use
this one.

 Yes.  Mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two

 If you only have one disk, then you can't use Level II SFT.  However, the

 that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the

 Try disconnecting the failed drive, using a standard disk controller, and

 in this configuration.

When a program uses a DOS call to get the system, it resets the flag that

LPT ports don't recognize baud, parity, etc. settings.  You might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port.  Try this: attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the PC.  Use the mode command to set
the COM port settings.  Try

C>MODE COM1,9600,N,8,1

to set the port parameters.  Then use the MODE command to redirect the

C>MODE LPT1=COM1

This should work.  Good luck!

Just a small tidbit: with the advent of DOS 3.3 and later versions, MS added
a small "feature" to the DOS time function.  If a program sets the DOS clock
via DOS system services, then DOS will set the BIOS clock to the same value.
This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that

Most XT IDE controllers are responsible for keeping track of the drive
geometry and getting the information to the computer.  The controller may
come with software to update its on-board BIOS, or may be designed to work
with a particular drive.  Seagate drives usually have special controllers
for use on XT's, and these are tailored to the drive.

Also, you cannot low-level format an IDE drive.  The low-level format is
stored on specal magnetic areas on the disk surface called "servos" (not

the drive's recording heads can generate.  Don't try to low-level format an

Call Phoenix.  They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips.  I had
to do this when I upgraded a Emerson 386/20 to an IDE drive.

Also, if you are installing an IDE drive, and there is a BIOS setting that
has a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume, try using it.  The
IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries, as long
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual
size.  The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in
most cases.

WARNING!!!  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive!  A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over.  Drive damage will not
result, but headaches will!

There is a software version of MNP-5 available from MTEZ, and it will often

Just a wild thought here, but how about this: there is a small boot program
on every formatted diskette, whether or not it contains system files.  It is
this small program that prints the "Non-System Disk" error, not DOS.  If
this program tries to transfer control to a BIOS location that is
nonstandard on the Gateway, then it could clear the BIOS.

I don't think that the BIOS is overwritten, there is usually a small routine
to clear the CMOS area, in case an invalid configuration prevents the

There are no standards for PC COM ports above COM2.  While there are "de

Is it possible to put more than 1 controller in a PC.  By this I mean of 
different types.  ie.  RLL and MFM.  If so how do you access the drives
in the CMOS setup.  Do they just show up to be configured or do you 
have to do low level writes to the controller.  

As an example put 1 RLL controller with 2 drives in a machine.  Put
a MFM controller and 2 more drives connected to it.  I now have 4
drives with 2 controllers of different types.  Also can you

Subject: 66DX2 ISA,VLB xor 50DX EISA ??  Advice wanted...
Organization: University of Western Ontario, London
Nntp-Posting-Host: vega.irus.rri.uwo.ca
Lines: 81


Hi:

I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!
I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:  

     -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)

     -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)

     -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under 
	Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel

     -	Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, 
	talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of
	the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.

I've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,
and decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be:

	486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus
	15" monitor, 1280x1024 NI
	3Com Etherlink III 16bit
	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive

However, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these
together, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise
surprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even
have a 50MHz local bus running...

I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus
the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind
that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  

Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any 
speedy help would be appreciated even more!!)



BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following 
configuration:

	486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram
	14" monitor, 1024x768 NI
	SMC Ethercard 8 bit
	Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive

We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!
~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or
been uncovered!  

There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish
running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take
a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).

There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive
don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with
medium size images.

I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This
machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec 
on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases
transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large 
images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it
make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice 
(above), for that reason.

Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

Any information is greatly appreciated.

I know you work at sun, but that's really no reason not to like fast 
computers. I suspect a conspiracy here. Are you trying to drag Intel through 
the mud at a con or something? I really wish you guys would make your own 
computers faster instead of degrading others'. Why don't you go straight for

No.  The simple $25 style IDE controller does not use DMA.  The CPU performs
the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the
CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive
controllers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA.  These controllers
tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.  To get the DMA benefits,
IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*.

Floppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't
an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller
board which handles all of these commands.

The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are
intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the
CPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor
to transfer their data.

The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the 
devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business.
Later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the
data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will
also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore
allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept
as dettach/callback.  

Can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system?

Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT,
that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk
controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format
program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from
debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it "knows" about.
Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you
can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a
third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like.

IDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the
drive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. Plug
it in and go to FDISK.

It's not true.  IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same
meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its (IDE bus) signal timing
doesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing.  My VL-IDE bus card has
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3MB/sec up to 8.3MB/
sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3
*milion* byte/sec and 8.3 *milion* byte/sec respectively).   You
cannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3MB/sec on the ISA bus.

Subject: Upgrading the processor on 386/486 machines
Organization: Harvard University Science Center
Lines: 43


In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine
without spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor
on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them).

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with
either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing
power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions.
This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz
machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz.
note: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if
you are running Windows.
Or, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX
on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you
were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed
of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even
if your original processor runs at a slower speed.
There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX
on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX
or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,
then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and
replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for
both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip
costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the
25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math
coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the
Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a
20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally
and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is
rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.

You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that
advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop
around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for
a particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.

However, I remember reading somewhere that to do this, you needed to 
reformat your original drive ?  Is this true ?  If so why ?  My drive is 
full and I really don't like the idea of to re-installing everything 
from floppy!!

    Please E-mail me, or post to the group

Rationale
---------
The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or
involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for
the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora
for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither
of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the
general cdrom community with focuses on library, government and
network usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted 
to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,
and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.
 
The reason for the division into three groups is a natural
partition of interest between the hardware and software topics,
and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext
and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, 
Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. 
Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly
hardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and
other legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in
the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other
nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom
publishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as
index and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom
simulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging
software, data capture software, data clean up, compression,
encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that
aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and
video.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that
relates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,
such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as
information that publishers need to know about the hardware that
the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will
eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.
 
Notes
-----
These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or
questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or
questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.
Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general
topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms
mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.

I have a Leading edge 486sx25 with 4 Megs of RAM that are in the forms of  
4 1 meg SIMMS.  Each SIMM has *two* chips on it. They are manufactured by  
Samsung and are 80ns.  A salesman told me that the leading edge CPC-2300  
motherboard has the extra parity bit built in and reccomemnded I use MAC  
SIMMS. I tried using 4 Megs pulled out of a Mac SI (these are 8 chip  
SIMMS), but I got too many windows protection faults and parity errors. I  
guess I should use the same SIMMS as the ones I have, but I can't find  
any!! Most of the places I have called carry only 3 8 or 9 chip SIMMS.

So if anybody knows where I can get memory that is good with my computer  
or if you have any suggestions at all, please let me know.

Any help is truly appreciated.

Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal
width hides out on the Tseng Labs ET4000 with a 15/16/24 bit dac?
I am trying to use the 640x480x16M mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but I
am not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et4000.
Anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register
(3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27, but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks)
is set to 0xEF, so 0x27 is nonsense. A resonable value would be 0x0127 - so is
there a high bit, and if so, where is it?
Also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and
what would be an appropriate frequency?). The documentation isn't really very
clear (tseng.txt from  vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site) about this.
My card is a MegaVga/1024 1Mb card. Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios (ver 8.05 I
think.) Works nicely under dos, and very well under unix (linux) in all the
non-hicolor modes. Great for running X-windows in up to 1152x900x256ni - if your
monitor will take it (only just in my case).

Please email the answer, as I can't read news very often.

Thanks very much,

	I have a 5FG and think it is great. I haven't seen the Nanao's so I
can't compare, but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is
*extremely* good. I've used other Trinitron monitors (e.g. a Sun SS2 color
monitors, which is a 19" Trinitron), and think the 5FG is at least as good,
perhaps brighter, and has *none* of these silly horizontal lines running across.
	BTW, I could be wrong, but I thought that the 5FGe is slower as well
as missing ACCUCOLOR. It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5FG
can.

Hi,

I recently got a tower-case for my Gateway 486/33 file server, mostly because
we needed the extra drive bays and better power supply.  This case has LED's

I work for a small PC OEM. We offer both a personal and professional

and DX-50 units.

N(P>Is there more than 1 type?

There are several manufacturers.

N(P>Do you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan?

Sometimes - depends on the specific fan model.

N(P>Do all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines?

All the ones I've seen do; many come with a 'Y' connector, so you don't
have to have a "spare" connector.

N(P>Anyone had any trouble with CPU fans?

None.

N(P>Does anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of
money?

Touch a 486DX-50 chip after its been running a few minutes - you won't
feel the fan is a waste!

N(P>How are these fans attached? (glue? clips? melted cheese?)

Depends on the model. Many use clips - make sure you use heat sink
grease, or heat transfering tape, or you will have wasted your money.

N(P>Roughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to
without? (an advert I've read claims 85F vs 185F)

Tough to tell - I do know the chip sheds a lot of heat.

Serial cables:

There are only three output signals: TD, DTR, and RTS.
There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI.

There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software.
The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and
CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and
waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an
error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending
AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it
with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very
well have different requirements.

My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but
also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD
and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through
to SG.

I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it
with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.
The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.

The current Adaptec drivers do not support the Toshiba 3401.  you should
get the Corel SCSI drivers, which do support it.

This is the method that I used, and it works well.

Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.
It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may
share experience on that.)

Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal
cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
So my advice is the 66/VLB.

| We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!

Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have

cached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more

bandwidth, this will work.

Note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA
controller.

Subject: *** CONSUMER WARNING ***  MidWest Micro (Ohio)
Organization: Consultant's Connection
Distribution: na
Lines: 54

Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully.
Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want
to trade elsewhere.

Despite the fact that they answer the phone, "Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're
having a GREAT Day!", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return
a modem that didn't work as I expected it to.

The details:

I ordered one of their house brand "Infotel" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.
In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over
the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not
have ordered it, had I known this in advance.

It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was
preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.

For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the
time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.

Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or
14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After
spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested
disabling the COM2 port.

This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long
term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both
would not be in use at the same time as the modem.

I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail 
hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I 
was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they 
didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.

I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA
number. She promptly switched me to a "Tech Support" rep that implied that
it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA
number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I
was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.

Conclusion:

I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does
not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more 
than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local
charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered
a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.

For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know 
will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal
experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have
known better...

I'm pretty sure SCSI is faster.  Along with a lot better compatability.

the Courier is their top-of-the-line product, thus the higher price.  I've
never taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what
I've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably
doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure
if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier
modems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.

again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated
the Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you
want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find
people who HAVE worked with the Sportster.

personally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd
buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this
is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right
now.

and now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want
to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to
comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll
get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you
may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts
complete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to
avoid spreading faulty info).

>The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression.

just as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in
either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only
operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is
currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary
mode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.

and just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also
supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).

>The difference
>with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. 

take a second look at the original question:

>In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says:
>>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST
modem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier
V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it
therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.

also, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb
version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are
even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.

>This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of
>the same type unit to achieve this speed.

HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about
HST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a
proprietary modulation scheme.

>The Sportster will do
>asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way
>only.

I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some
way.....

first off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is
part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a
feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter
in the Courier DS manual).

second, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an
asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed
in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,
and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed
channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if
you're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of
info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,
a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse
directions.

V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full
data rate in both directions at the same time.

third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with
symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.

>The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.

again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable
to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large
footprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an
upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which
could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two
upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.

later.....

In a 25-pin serial loopback plug, you need to connect the following
pins:

pin 1 to pin 7
pin 2 to pin 3
pins 4, 5 and 8 together
pins 6, 11, 20 and 22 together
pins 15, 17 and 23 together,
pin 18 to pin 25.

That should do it.  Note that *a lot* of these pins are redundant
in many implementations....

2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and
    everything works fine until I run windows, when

    (In case it's important, the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card.  It's I/O
     address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is
     D000.  It's also using IRQ 2)

    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that

Subject: Re: Any info on Cyrix 486DRu2 chip?
Organization: Netcom - Online Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)
Lines: 64

It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible
486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:
And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.

The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX
socket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.
the 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any
software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the
coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the
actual coprocessor.

The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit
rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance
boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a
386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and
QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,
is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is
around the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,
and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2
compatibility, but I didn't test it.

The 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually
a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains
the logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX
PGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board
doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when 
access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available
from Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20
only.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.
If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need
to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...

I also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K
external cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still
significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.

IMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or
can't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,
but if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure
about the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't
beat it in any significant way.

The last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,
asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:

Treasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.
1-800-677-9781
The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00

But....

I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.
If you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you
more info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,
So I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions
regarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.

The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple 
and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an "idle" temp - not doing lots of
bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This
is in a Micron computer, without heatsink.

I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but I might take the fan off.  It
makes a horrible whine at times, and I wonder what the vibration is doing to
the pins on the cpu etc...

Rob,
Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks
of use, mine did...
As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have
a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan
on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink
instead. Work just like a charm, but the realy biggy to think about
is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out)
how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what
you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not
had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled
circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes
above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. Cheep to do if
you use Radio Shack junk under $5....Think about that one for a while!

I bought a 386DX-40 motherboard for 50$... no documentation at all. Everything
appears to work, except I'm having trouble getting a few of the LED connectors
working. I've looked at the manuals for 4 other motherboards, but the pin
configuration doesn't look anything like what is on this board. Does this
pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there??? Any hints on where I
can find this information?

I can get the power/keylock to work across pins 11-15, reset across pins 9 and
19, but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation.
The date on the board itself is 6/92, opti chips.

I would really appreciate any help, and thank you in advance.

[REMAINDER DELETED]

I don't have my copy of the manual with me right now, but I can offer the
following in the interim:

   1)  The card uses port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8 (which are NOT
       configurable).  These addresses, incidentally, were inadvertantly
       omitted from my version of the manual.

   2)  I believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable
       IRQ 2 (for CGA or EGA support??!?).

Lance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)
               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.

I must say that I have been a customer of Midwest Micro for over 4
years now, and have been well taken care of on each purchase.
I have had many friends that have bought that same modem and (THEY)
do have some experience with setting up modems, so there have been
no problems in 6 of them that I know of. The fact that your time
to valuable for you to spend on the modem is where you went wrong.
WHY you say because I must tell you of the 12 yes I say 12 PPI modems
that I have had in the past that I was trying to use on my bbs. They
all were junk and were replace 3 times each, to ther point that
I just said forget it and I wanted my money back. PPI's teck even
said that they didn't even repair them. That they just strip the
parts that are good and junk thr rest of the modem.
I think it was more your fault than Midwest Mirco's faulkt...Sam

I ran out of time on my last reply to this string and I don't
know if it was sent or not but. I have never heard of anyone that
had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem
at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't
know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem.
But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct
things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because
it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the
instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system.
When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like
you have connected to another EC modem, doesn't realy say that.
But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on, on your modem.
I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up
the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$
in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award
of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test
bench. I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems
that I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself.
I will not even go into the 6 weeks it took PPI to credit my card
back for the modems after they had received them back...no I will
not go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co.
co from Hayes. I'll just say I hope you like your new modem and
maybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will get
the one that you sent back, maybe a good friend of mine I hope!

All,

During my attempts to find out how the AT harddisk controller
works I stumbled across I/O port 376h. The "normal" controller
ports are in the 1F0h-1F7h range, so what does this port do???

The only information I have upto now about this port is that it
is a write only port and the information you have to write in it
is related to the number of heads on the disks.

Could somebody shed some light on this and give me the missing info.

It's the video card.  It's 8514/A compatible, which means it uses the

Article-I.D.: eskimo.C5uw1t.3HI

Lines: 30

Hello, I've been following discussions on 17" monitors in 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good
reviews.  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products
as well as some others that may fit the bill.   

I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI.
I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics
board like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically
I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large
(=>17") if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been
very happy with a 16" on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home.

I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi
monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty
good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very
often as are Mag and Viewsonic.

Ok, stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are
the products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. what
scan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  What's list and street
cost - if avail. from a third party, and where can I get ahold of them? 
Same info for Sony and Hitatchi.

Thank you very much!!

hello,

for 2 months I've unsuccessfully attempted to get either
a 3rd or 4th serial port working on my system.

various systems diagnostics (e.g., MSD, Norton) tell me
it's there, but anything I hook up to it can't use it

I have two serial ports on the motherboard

if I set my internal FAX/modem for com4 the utility
programs report a COM3

I've checked to make sure all the IRQs and addresses are
correctly (as listed in most manuals) set

am I missing something very basic?

where should I go from here?

any help, even a point in the right direction, would be
most appreciated.

Use tar on the Un*x box and gtak110.zip on the DOS box. Needs ASPI driver.

You can configure devices for the same IRQ as long as you don't use them
*simultaneously*, under Dos at least. Both LPT1: and SB just sit there until
you tell them to do something. You can't configure a SoundBlaster for IRQ7
if you got an Ethernet Card which hits that IRQ a thousand times or so per 
second.

I totally agree with your friend, since when the CPU is apparently idle
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second
(checking for keyboard input for instance).  

The exception to this is for CPU's used in laptops, where the CPU can
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but
doing absolutely nothing.  In this case it needs a hardware interrupt
to get it going again.

Hi,

I have the following problem: I have to use a computer for special purposes

I can't disable the keyboard from BIOS setup (in fact, there is no setup).
I spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the BIOS with simply
using a self-made connector that connects two pins via a resistor.
Pity, pity... I lost contact to the person before getting more detail.
So does anyone of you experts can help?

Thanks for any hints, even vague ones :-)

I dont think you can mix the two types of drive, unless you have one of the
SCSI/IDE cards that is available.  You will have to turn your IDE off.

Instructions for drive type are included with the controller.  With some it may be
a type 1. no matter what the disk is.  With others it may be a type 47.  I had one
controller that I had to tell the BIOS that no hard disk was installed.

Do not low level format a SCSI unless you have the SCSI low level format program. 
First use fdisk to set the partitions, then use format.

Hello,

a second harddisk, he now has 100+200 MB. But the problem is that
the 200MB harddisk isn't supported in the bios. Alas there's no user type

getting bad blocks on the harddisk :-<. Question: who knows a solution to this?
I've seen a small program for this once in the BYTE, but I haven't been able
to find this. Would speedstor or diskmanager work for this, I used these
programs quite a lot in the XT-days, but I don't have these anymore, Seagate
used to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold.

I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet.  The nameplate does not 
specify a number, but since the LJ II followed later, one assumes that he 
has a LJ I.   His problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to 
print the forms properly.

This unit came to market in 2 versions.  The plus version supported 
dowloadable fonts.  You can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not 
the plus.  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction 
of cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font.

Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?  
Alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable 
cost?

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Thanks

This is normally the case, but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator
as you will screw up your warranty if you start to solder the board.

IBM, Apple, Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor


The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week, as Motorola
Corp., IBM, and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong
effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit
processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s
Pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions
per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola
is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two
configurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50
SPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance
for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89
performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down
version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000
workstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip
with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus
built in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the
Micro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop
PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,
including ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source
noted.

According to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has
been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive
architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million
transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to
be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s
486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one
source said.

we are talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller.

Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section:
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous}
 SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these
 modes is mainly in the software drivers.
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. 
 Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for
 a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.
SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.
 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using
 SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which
 results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit
 and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software
 drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI
 interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term
 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},
 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 {32-bit}.

8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 
that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software
controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds
for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT
NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit
SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1
electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider
16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but
4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1
but is 8-bit SCSI-2.
Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.

8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost
compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.

I own a PC FanCard II, which is a slightly different beast.  It's a long card
that plugs into an 8 or 16 bit slot and contains two muffin fans.  It requires
no extra cabling.  I had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to
heat.  The FanCard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no
longer appears.  It's supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range
of 75-95 degrees Fahrenheit.  According to the maker's (M.S. Tech)
advertisements, the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running
(w/o a/c) in Desert Storm.  I can't vouch for that.  However, I am a satisfied
customer.  And I have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order
house (Lyben  (313) 268-8100).

Hope this helps,

Half right.
SCSI-1 is SLOWER than IDE {5MB/s vs 8.3MB/s maximum.}
SCSI-2 {8-bit} has a faster BURST rate than IDE {Quarda}
SCSI-2 {16 and 32-BIT} are MUCH faster than IDE {Cyclone in June}

Give the new Viewsonic 17 a good look.  I have seen it side by side with
an old Viewsonic 7, a MAG 17, a Nanao 17" (not the Trinitron one), and
a Sony OEM 17" (which does have a Trinitron tube).  The new Viewsonic
beat all of them easily in terms of picture quality, and I think it is

   Even if you are running DOS, if your CPU can't handle the speed of the

There's also a program called ODYSSEY (MODEM directory on the Simtel

Well, I have a different story to recount.  I attempted to low-level format a
WD 43MB disk about a year ago.  When I understood my error, I contacted WD.
They told me that I hadn't hurt the drive and that I should just run FDISK and
FORMAT/S on it.  It was fine.  Also, I understand that Western Digital's BBS
may have some low-level formatting routines specifically available for IDE
drives.  You probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop.

Don't even get hyped up.  They are still accepting submissions from the
members for various proposals of how to implement the standard.

You don't seem to realize that while v32bis was just an extension of
v32 (which took years to pass, implement, and finally sell at a reasonable
price), v.fast requires all new technology (not just faster DSP chips, etc.)
to achieve its performance.

Wait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly
after that.

FOR SALE:

AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem

The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer
than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,
v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so
you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone
line.  They will "fall back" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even
disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to
connect with slower and older modems.

It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with
multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).

They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)
which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and
cleanest connection possible.

These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech
support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.

They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the
NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which
will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows
application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of
any font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax
graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,
as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).

I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or
below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an
equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is
backed by a company that will never go away.

This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of
downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home
to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal
modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including
installation.)

If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem
at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for
about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.

If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at 
(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.

The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

Thanks.

OK, here's my results so far....

1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support
   Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)

2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved
   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.
   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)

3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.

OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC
which will act as a universal sync decoder.

I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting
the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.

There are 2 reasons for doing this

1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're
   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.

2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,
   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.
   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA
   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,
   I can get down to 1.

Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,
but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...

   I am DESPERATELY trying to find a PC based e-mail wide area network service
or the necessary network software to establish one myself. While I am aware
there are various BBS's and other similar services avalible (like Compuserve,
Canada Remote Systems etc.) I require fairly specific criteria. In 
approximate order of importance they are:

1) The mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network
   server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(NOTE: all users are remote
   and will use modems over conventional phone lines.)

2) Simple. The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge
   have never heard of Unix, and have very little interest in learning. It is
   essential that the client software is completely pain-free.

3) Cheap. We would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established
   commercial network, just so we can send large files between members of the
   group - hence (1). In addition I would like the network server to be
   something small, simple and inexpensive like a 486. (There are only about
   40 people in the group, so it is not a huge network.)

4) The capability for Internet access (for news/mail).

5) Internet style id's (eg. pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca)


   If anyone knows of a system similar to what I am describing, even if it
doesn't sastisfy all my criteria, and I don't care where it is, PLEASE PLEASE

Once again, someone else with a Gateway Monitor problem, anyone who can
help, please do, it would be much apprieciated.  Thanks in advance.

Ok, I have a Local Bus 486/66 machine, with the Crystal Scan 15inch
monitor.  I have 1 meg of loca memory on the ATI ultra pro, w/ the
mach32 driver (the newest release).

My problem is in Windows when I use the 1024 mode. I get shadows down
the sides of the screens, and very blurry type in the corners.  The
types on the screen are all out of focus. I've gotten replacement video
cards, and a replacement monitor.  None of that has helped though.
Could someone pleae help me with this very frustruating problem.

Thanks again,
Josh Smith

I don't see this as a problem with the chip-set (a mistake), I see this
as something that was designed-in intentionally.

So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA)
would require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may 
begat an update to the motherboard board design.

What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this
off as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT 
along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple.
If I were you I would be cautious about this.

You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA
motherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are
VL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real'
32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive
than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board.

Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother-
board.  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it.  I'm
attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the
AIR board.

Model number of AIR board (with 486-33DX) is B433EI2.  You can call
Motherboard Warehouse (for example) for a price.  Phone #'s included

I downloaded these files a couple of days ago and they appeared to be
incompatible with this particular card. None of the SVGA drivers worked.
They're probably for the newer 8900 and 9000 series.

Hello,
    I'm trying to use the BIOS timer interrupts (which occur every .055
seconds, or 18.2 times a second) to time people's response times, in a
psychology experiment, and the response times are on the order of .01
seconds. Is there any way I can get better precision than by counting
ticks? Or can I make the ticks occur more frequently? I'm trying to do
this in DOS 5.0 on a 386, and it would be nice if this could also work
on our old 8086 machines running DOS 2.1 (I know, I know, I don't like
them any more than you do) but this is by no means a requirement, just a
possibility. 
    So, basically, any information on the BIOS tick scheme and the
related inrterruots would be appreciated, as well as any information on
alternate ways of improving accuracy. Email is preferred, as I'm
planning on posting this to a few boards, and I don't read all of them.
Thanks

     No, it's not true.  You can get SCSI and IDE to work together, but
there are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542):

* You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the
  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives.

* You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though),
  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI
  drive.  (Hmm.  I know that you have to disable something related to
  the SCSI BIOS, but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.)

     Back in February, someone asked about IDE and SCSI (this question
gets asked again and again).  At the end of this message, I've included
an edited copy of my reply.  You might find it interesting.

     For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers
generally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher
throughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk
($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a
good SCSI controller.

     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're
used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).
Unfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking
operating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is
mostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to
connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.
However, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.

     If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's
cheaper, and you'll have less headaches.

[ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what
  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]

     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,
which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the "better"/"high
performance" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI
controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and
drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular
name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased
(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:

* Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI
  controllers.

* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).
  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card
  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.

     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape
drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it
works only with Adaptec controllers.

     Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a
high-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound
right, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers,
you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound
cards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and
Windows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI
controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape
backups).  If you want a copy of my "Adaptec 1542 hints and tips" file,
send email.

     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card;
the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of
the PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card
is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.

     SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC
compatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows
3.1, stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'll
have to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than
one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the
possible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say, "probably", because,
while I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this really
will be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will, but I don't know
for sure.  ]

Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the
following is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified
explanation.

Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer
adapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that
"Something's happening here, please take note." How the CPU is
programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.
In MS-DOS, the "interrupt vector" is used to store the address of the
function that handles each interrupt.

Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready
to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When
DOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,
wait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to
the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's
free for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. 

With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing
approach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU
cycles.) Hence, you can't "share" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're
running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.

Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses
interrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what
to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is
required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is
needed.

You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use
them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine
is same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came
from. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.

Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the
general picture correctly enough.

But, but, but... How does buying an external modem solve the problem
of wanting more than 2 serial devices at once?  And since the PC
only supports two, why are you blaming a modem vendor for the
problem?  I don't see how your experience could have been different
with any internal modem.

I had one and on three different motherboards it didn't work with NT and
in some cases DOS. I sent mine back, but it is my understanding that
on some systems such as Micronics motherboards it is necessary to
shut off the internal cache on the 486 to have it work.

I've yet to hear from someone running a 34F on any motherboard with
NT without shutting off the cache.

If you get one my advise it to be very sure you can return it first.

        I am considering selling an Atari 1040 and purchasing an IBM compa-
tible.  I need to know what kind of money or trade I can expect to get for
the Atari before I bother.  I am about to start graduate school, and that
means I'm about to be poor!  (There's a price list for used synthesizers on
rec.music.makers.synth, but no equivalent list for computers...)

This system is tailor-made for a MIDI musician.  Details follow:

  * Atari 1040 ST
      TOS 1.0
      1 MB RAM
      720K floppy drive

  * SupraDrive 20 Mb external SCSI drive, 18 months old

  * 12" Atari monochrome monitor

  * Generic 2400 baud external modem

  * Software: All software is registered and comes with manuals.
      Passport's Master Tracks Pro, Version 2.5 (sequencing software)
      Dr. T's Copyist Professional (scoring software)
      First Word (word processor - *not* the PD version)
      Megamax's Laser C, Version 2.0 (programming language)
      VIP Professional (spreadsheet package - low-tech Lotus clone)
      Partner ST (desk accessory with integrated calendar, cardfile, etc.)
      Migraph's Easy Draw (an early, pre-Postscript release)
      NeoDesk (improved desktop for Atari ST)
      Universal III (improved file selector for Atari ST)
      Miscellaneous software (including Uniterm communications software)


        I will consider all prices above $900.  I am also willing to
trade the Atari system for a quality (386 or 486) PC, including lap-tops.
I own some PC hardware, so a complete system may not be necessary.

Maybe I should have been clearer.  I have a Intel 386DX/25 that I would
like to use to put together a system however all the motherboards that
the local vendors are now selling are running either at 33 or 40 MHz.  I
guess I can cross my fingers and hope the CPU runs at that speed. ;^)

I think I'll take Mark's advice and see if any of the boards have
a socketed oscillator and head down to the local electronics store...

I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday, and installed it into my Gateway
DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5
(the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how
should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation
program recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to
IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now
I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this "cascade to
IRQ8-15" business?  

A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that 
only DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about
32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus
extension to do 32-bit DMA?

Yet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang
the machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode??
Civilization however works fine ( at least so far). Any body knows what I might
have done wrong?

Do these CPU Fans also have heat sinks?  Do you recommend using both
on the same chip (i.e. heat sink sandwiched between CPU and Fan)?

If we are just talking about a CPU Fan blowing directly on the CPU chip,
I can't see how "heat sink grease" is necessary (or even desireable).

Not so! I have both IDE and an Adaptec1542B in the same box and can use both

NO! I'm running both at home. Ok, to the cumpter is turned off right now but I

I'm using an Adaptec 1542B and a no-name el-cheapo IDE card.

A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card.  A pretty nice
board.  Fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the
SVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion.  At the time I was just
buying a VLB system, so after checking out the card I sent it back.  I wanted
a VLB card, and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card.  This card is fairly fast,
will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS
(the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of
an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those
programs than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straight
answer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17" Magnavox,
which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match.

But...

That is for my wife.  I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 for myself, and am
looking for a graphics card to drive it.  I want > 70Hz refresh,
and would really like it to handle my CD-Roms.  I tried the Orchid P9000,
which did neither of those things (though Robert at Wietek did say that the
>70Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base).  So my thoughts go back
to Hercules.  They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the
Graphite around the end of March.  I have heard precisely ZERO about it since
then.  Does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities
(and price) it has?

Any info would be most appreciated.

There are jumpers on each drive that must be set for both to work.  The C: drivemust be set to be the master drive, and D: must be set to be the slave drive.

Does anyone know if there are any problems (or if it's possible)
adding a third hard drive(scsi) to a dos pc.

I currently have a 386 pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  2
Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed.  They work great, I haven't had
any problems!

Well, now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another
(larger)  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it
to the chain(50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors)   and   run
the   fdisk   program   to format/initialize the disk.

That didn't happen.  When the pc boots, the  scsi  prom   shoots
back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the board[target
0/target1/target2].  All three disks are seen.

When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk, I choose to
select another  disk(option  5(dos6)) and voila, it's not there.
The first two disks show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is
no-where to be found....



ARGH!

Ideas anyone?????

What tube does the Viewsonic 17 use?  Does is support 1600x1280?  I've been
looking a a Philips 1762DT which uses a Sony Trinitron tube, has digital
controls, supports up to 1280x1024NI, and has .25mm dot pitch - It can be
found for under $1000.

Does anyone have any experience or is familiar with the Cardinal P9000
VL-Bus graphics card?  Would appreciate knowing what you think of its

I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK, but is unhookable
to anything standard (CGA,EGA,VGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy
diagonal noise. 
I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board
(double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector
with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT
to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to
be of relatively high quality, so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or
setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card.

Yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 BNC's on it, and is expecting
to get a composite sync signal on the "green"?  There ought to be a
little black box that takes the VGA signalling (which has horiz, vert,
and composite sync on different pins, plus the R, G, and B pairs) and
merges the green and composite sync together in the output.  It's all
1V analog, as far as I know.  I can build this with op-amps but I don't
think I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies
involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen.

Does anyone know of a VGA->RGB(composite sync on green) converter?

With your date/time problems, you MIGHT have a problem with the Dallas

look at the battery and the clock chip when such things go wrong--
at least, as the first course of action.

  Hmm your CD-Rom program must be using some oddball VGA modes.

  I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month, when
it is released though it'll be in limited quantities, I think they
have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out
a bit later).

  Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal
frequency right?), you're gonna love the 2 megs version.  It can
do 1280x1024x256 at 75Hz, 1152x900x256 at 80Hz, 1024x768x256 at 90Hz(!),
1024x768x65536 at 75Hz.  It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and
800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth 
monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor,
otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)

  If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you should
go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in the
video sig.  There're several Hercules reps there that are very
helpful.

It's transparent. It works with any drive. If you change the

That depends. You will get a little better performance
if you use smartdrive and buffers in addition. That's
because access to the card through the ISA bus is slower
than access to system RAM. I don't use smartdrive myself,
but I have a few buffers.

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now.
SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives
(ESDI,RLL,IDE,etc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers
to get it to work with odd environments.

For information purposes, I had:

ST-01 Card + ST296N drive and a MAXTOR 212a drive with generic IDE
controller running together. I have also had the same SCSI setup work
in combination with a RLL drive, the ST251-1 drive.

(stuff deleted)

My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.
I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has
precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial
heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably
dissipate more heat than the bare chip.

It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case, so
the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
go.

All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable.
There are other "board" type fans which are ISA boards with a couple
of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't
know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment.

The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit.

Hi,

I bought, on the net here, a mini-tower 386dx25 system.  It works fine, but
I have no docs on the motherboard.

Does anyone know who a manufacturer named WPI is?  That is the only marking
on the board that is not related to a chip/connector name.  It says
(c)1991, WPI

Also, this board has a connector at the other end of the motherboard, it looks
like this:

                       What is this connector?

Is this a place to plug an extra memory board in?  I've seen thatr mentioned
in some motherboard docs.  Some allow an 8-meg card and 8 meg in simms.  Is
this what it is for?

Nntp-Posting-Host: brahms.udel.edu
Organization: University of Delaware
Lines: 43


I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  
I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison:

							Wintach
             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system:
486/33 VLB:
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58

my system -
486sx/33 VLB:
VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 
drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, 
I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
least that was what the program said.

I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3, but
when I insert that card into my DOS 5.02 PC, it shows up
as COM3, with IRQ3 and COM4's address (2E8)!

When I get into debug, and dump the data at 40:0, it shows
the address 2E8 as belonging to COM3 - even though the modem
should be at COM4.

Now, I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested
it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4, 2E8, IRQ3.

To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC, I have to configure the
modem as COM3, 2E8, IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that
allows that, the FAX program that came with the modem does not work.
Anyway, I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set,
as COM4...
I did run a few diagnostic programs, and they did not help at all:
a few displayed the modem as COM4, and others displayed it as
being COM3.

I am not using Windows, this is just a DOS problem...Any help
or pointers appreciated....
For various reasons, I must have this modem work at COM4, thus
switching COM ports is not an answer...

(Last time I posted this, I did not get any DOS specific answer,
this time I have included all the specific information....please help!)

I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5" drives, in

Maxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm, 1.2 gig) drive. They are all quite cheap,
and have nice 3-5 year warranties. 

My questions are: Is there a catch?
                  Which one is better?
                  What type of SCSI-2 do these drives use?
                  Is the service generally better for one of these

He's right ya know.  I've helped to install Dos 6 on about 4 computers now,
mine included.  On one, he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter,
and it worked fine (rather, he sent in the coupon for the converter).

In other cases, I've run the doublespace installation without a problem
when compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else.
Seems to work for me.

Well, I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever that's
worth.

Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still
faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression,
I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin
load before anything else.  With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys
or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.

Personally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those
hooks and stuff.  Plus, the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay, but I
much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus,
defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive.

I'm a novice in messing comp. hardware.
My original IDE HD is a 42MB Western Digital which came with the system
when I bought it. And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to
add as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor to
configure it as slave drv, but I didn't change anything on my 42M Western
Dig, since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted, It just beeped
and gave me an error message about HDD controller.
So, I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD.
 
any help on this matter would be much appreciated.

Which would YOU choose, and why?

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).
I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according
to NU).

How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for
my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the best system I could
hope for)?

Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

Thanks for any comments.

Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember
those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? These drives
are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb
disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the
prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently
not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to
develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there
any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?

Just a thought.

this light is also the power light.....  on (not blinking) just means that

right?

don't know why it would do this, unless you're out of paper, that is.

when you power up the printer, assuming it does have paper, the red power
light (which, when flashing, doubles as paper out) should light, and a few
seconds later, the green ONLINE light should come on.

DECNET requires this feature.

However, that said, there is no reason to ever change the Ethernet

You may want to save yourself the trouble and go to Radio Shack.  They have
a null modem adapter which is a 9 pin connector that swaps the necessary
pins to allow two machines to communicate.  These are a lot easier than
soldering the connections yourself, and usually a bit more reliable.

Diamond Video cards (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...) 
may have excellent specifications, and the windows drivers that
come with them might make windows BLINDINGLY fast, BUT:

If you're considering buying a system, with a view to using
it to run Unix (Linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special software,
there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards.
This is due to Diamond's propriety attitude to it's hardware:
it's impossible to get free information from them about their chips

Hi peeps,

Here's another of those "any ideas" type queries.

I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy, without
a keyboard.  But no problem so far.

When I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standard
RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc.

Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I
connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of.

The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines.
The display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to
CGA - but useful for my laptop).

Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors?

I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that
he has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer
is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said
sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway?
A UK support dealer said "Circuit diagrams? Sync?"

So any ideas.

John.

I'm arguing with the phone company about a similar problem.  We
installed a second phone line in our home (for our kids), and whenever
one of them is on THEIR line, the modem returns "NO DIAL TONE" on its
line.

When we pick up the phone and listen, we can hear my kids' voices
"bleed" through.  Whenever we can hear this, the modem won't dial (even
though the dial tone is loud and clear through the modem speaker).

I think it's the phone company's problem, but they say they can't
(won't?) correct the problem...I'm still working on them. ;-}

Seeing all these questions about uart types, their availability, and their

were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and
instead accessing directly the relatively large send/receive buffers of the

Since you're using the 5.25 as drive A: it should be at the end after the

Hope this helps.  I had exactly the same problems.  Unfortunately when

of a different FDC.  Seems (don't flame me, this is mainly guess work

select.

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to
use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS
limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other
standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better
performance, though. You have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks.

>Will this also be true of the 32-bit OS's?

Obviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes that
are written for DOS, so you need software drivers. That's not a big
deal (as long as the drivers are available), because you won't have to
fight with any low memory problems either.

Doesn't anybody actually read the licence agreement of WinBench
before blindly running it? The licence agreement very clearly says
that details about hardware configuration, driver, resolution and
other relevant facts *MUST* be included when giving WinMark results.

Ziff-Davis wants everybody to do this and that requirement makes
sense, really! Plain numbers are useless when resolution, driver and

The original poster, John Navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on
a SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at
76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't
handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly.

When buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a SparcStation
LX, you might consider a monitor that's fast enough to do 1280*1024 at 76Hz.
I don't know for sure whether the LX supports this (Sun certainly won't tell

hi folks
i have a 386 25 mhz and now i'm buying a new 486
first question) which is the best way to share hard disks
and printer
p.s. my two pc will be far about 10 meter and i like to use
a parallel port or ethernet card and i like to share resource
under dos linux os2.1 and windows 3.1 & nt

2) which 486? i think to buy 486 dx2 50mzh local bus
  but i heard that some board coulnd't work properly 
  cause some incompatibilites is that true?

  should a 486 dx 50 mhz a better solution

  in case i buy local bus it's better to buy an accelerated
  svga card with a normal local bus ide controller
  or it is better to buy a local bus svga card non accelerated
  with a normal ide controller?

  3)  is there any accelerated local bus and possibly true color 
      svga card? at which price?   
  4) i need to buy a cd which is the cheapest that is able to read
     musical photo kodak and computer cd rom
     i have heard about a sony and a mitsumi which is best?
     and which controller work with its?



     thank to everyone anserw me

Micronics & AMI came out with EISA/VLB motherboards.
Byte Mag tests indicate that VLB is faster for video

GW2K to hopefully start using the Micronics board.

I am planning on upgrading my old XT compatible system with a new
motherboard, hard drive, and 1.4 MB floppy.

I am interested in using my old power supply (150 W) to power the new
hardware, if possible.  

I have been told by the motherboard vendor that I could probably
use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard.
(Apparently some XT vintage supplies had only 11 wires -- the
12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery).

My question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire
out of an 11 wire supply OR using an auxiliary power source
to charge the motherboard battery?

I do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if I can 
make use of my existing one with simple hacks.

Thank you for any information.  
An email reply to rarbanas@rcsuna.gmr.com would be fine.

For the past week or so I've been trying to install a QIC-36 tape drive
and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 EISA system with no
luck. I end up getting an error (miscompare) during the streaming read
part of the test. I am pretty certain that the port setting, irq & dma are
set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind,
retension, write and erase, I also booted the system clean and still the
same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. It has been
suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down.
My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting
option that I have seen on other systems so I cant do this. Am I going to
have to accept that this set up won't work? or can anyone suggest a work
around? I will be glad to hear your advice/suggestions.

[discussing the use of IRQ 7]

In  recent article msprague@superior.mcwbst311b (Mike Sprague) writes:

>I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written
>(I can't prove it's true, but I believe it), LPT1 does not

>be dedicated to LPT1.

To put it a little differently:

 - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.

 - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's
   time to send out another byte to the printer.

 - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the
   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it
   in the high-impedence mode.

 - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines
   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't
   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes
   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper.

   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold
   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and
   that certainly isn't a requirement.)

 - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the
   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance
   reasons.  

And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.

BusLogic just announced the BT445 FAST SCSI-2 VLB Interface as of
April 20.  This always happens to me!

I have a one week old BT545S which is the ISA version.  I am
enjoying spectacular performance with a Micropolis MC2105 560mb 10ms
3.5" HH 5200 RPM drive.  I'll be changing to the BT445 VERY soon,
though it is difficult to imagine even higher transfer speeds with
the 32bit VESA support.

You can call BusLogic and ask 'em about the NT question. I hear that
the support is excellent.   I have not had to call them myself yet.
Regards.

I recall reading a review article in PC Computing wherein they reported
a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using Stacker 3.0.
This was not due to the compression algorithm per se, but to the fact
that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access. Does
anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of Stacker
and Dblspace?

One of the things going for the DX2-66 (over the 50) is that it's
clock speed complies with the VESA local bus spec.

Most fellow Diamond video board owners with whom I've corresponded may
or may not share your opinion about the proprietary clocking scheme, but
all of those with whom I've chatted have NOT been thrilled with the
Window's drivers, either.  Some modes work fine, but others cause
strange misdrawn objects, trails, etc.  Many have also voiced their
strong discontent to Diamond's ambivalent attitude toward OS/2 drivers.

Come to think of it, though, I hear and see a lot of complaints about
the ATI boards too, though recent word looks like the build 59 code looks
much better.

Does ANYONE have an accelerated video board with drivers for Windows
(OS/2?) where ALL the modes function properly?  Anyone?  Anyone?

Certainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a
cheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP
200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more
expensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.

A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb
flopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do
they need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy
drive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk
and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.

On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a
PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing
optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a
product themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format
is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is
identical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was
quoted as saying that a 2.5" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data
though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being
productized.

The article said that one of the problems holding back development in
this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2
distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it
probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it
into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it
probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead
to get MDs accepted.

I hope that there's somebody out there that can help us.

Some of our students change the AMI bios passwords on a few of our computers 
and set it for always. What we'd like to know is if there is a way to bypass 
or remove the password. We have tried switching bios, but to no avail. The 
battery is soldered to the bord, an all three machines is still under 
guarentee so if that would have help we can't remove the batteries.

That is, if the special software is free, like Xfree86.  There are
vendors that sells Diamond X drivers for commercial Unices.  But
then, they charge $$$$.

I think they only need a signing (i.e. no paying).  This still
violates the FSF's policy of publically available code.

While this is true, there are fixes for those who have already
bought Diamond cards.  In Linux, for example, there are utilities
that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course,
this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least this
will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X.

I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card
for specialized free software, avoid Diamond.  But if you already
have one, there may be a fix that can help you.

James.

I would never even think of installing anything that looked like
it was used at all. You should of called Medwest Micro

Invar shadow mask.  ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use
system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I have
been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,

As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by 
shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This 
will remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS 
settings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, 
there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of 
shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts 
power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is 
something like this on your board too. 

In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on 
"Setup" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to "
Always" unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over 
here too when they got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason.

Subject: ISA GRAPHIC CARD INFO SOURCE
Organization: Universite de Montreal
Lines: 38

HI,
 that might look like a dull request, but I have been following this newgroup
for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind.

  I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the
pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!).
The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It
gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only
problem is that it is quite slow.

I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot
of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall
picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody
direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest.
I would like to get information about :
     - the refresh rates the various cards provide;
     - quality of windows drivers;
     - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff).

Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip 
info, but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied
with it,  let me know.
	If this information is of any use, here is my system configuration:
	- Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard)
	- monitor DARIUS 14" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768) 
                               (can reach 70kHz horizontally)  

I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow
screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the
graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient
when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent 
enough to record settings.

Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me,

This isn't quite true - depending on the number of local bus slots, and
whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board, it is
possible to run local bus at up to 40 and 50 mhz. I've also spoken to a few 
people who run standard local bus video cards at 50 mhz without trouble
(and a couple of people who couldn't get a lb card to work at that speed).

the "attached" fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential

I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout, though.

on-chip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about 30.00. I
get the stock power supply fans for about 11.00.

Yes, this is a valid concern IMHO.  With the directly attached fan units I've
seen, it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be 
a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words, if the fan stops
the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to
suffer permanent damage, not just stop working temporarily.

My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu, and it's
located so the front fan, which sucks air into the case, blows right on the
heat sink.  If that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air

My PC is a 486-33DX (ISA) with AMI BIOS and OPTI chipset. I am thinking of replacing the AMI BIOS chip (dated 6-91) with an up-to-date one (not for any reason, just messing around). My questions are:

1. Do I just take out the old one and plug in a new?

2. Anything else I have to take care of? What precautions should I take?

3. Where can I get the new BIOS chip, CompUSA, mailorder or what? (I live in Orange County California).

4. What is the most up-to-date version?

5. Very important. How much would it be?

Thank you for your help.

Gateway service has confirmed my suspicion, echoed by a couple of people
who responded to the original request for help.  The ATI VLB video board
uses the addresses for COM 4.  They could suggest no work around.
I will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM 4 (even though it
could not possibly work) for credit against a bus mouse.  This will free
up the COM port I need - too bad the original salesman who suggested either
the DF IO card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know
enough about the hardware.

Otherwise I must say that the 486DX2/66 system has worked very well - no
problems with any other hardware or software.

	Build 59 still has a number of problems--sheared fonts, for

	To be honest, up until now, I have only found one bug in the 
	Diamond Viper drivers, and it seems innocuous.

	That is, under Microsoft Word, select Format Border, click
	shading and take a look at the patterns.  The 5% pattern
	has been swapped with the 90%, and so on.  The whole list
	is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take
	it to another machine (i.e., a GUP or ss24x machine) or
	print it and iy shows--badly!  

	Keep in mind that I use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so I can't
	speak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty 
	solid.

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE, it depends on the
drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr.
it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly
4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the
controller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest
but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast
speed. I havent used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice.

I purchased one personal computer and three for business from them. No

about a video driver and I had no problem getting through.

All four machines seem to be high quality and well made.  A 486dx50 EISA

Connecting devices
------------------
 
  Normally, a 7 wire connection is used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
	RxD1    to    TxD2
	TxD1    to    RxD2
	DTR1    to    DSR2
	DSR1    to    DTR2
	RTS1    to    CTS2
	CTS1    to    RTS2
  If a modem is connected, add lines for the following:
        RI, DCD
  If software wants it, connect DCD1 to CTS1 and DCD2 to CTS2.
  BEWARE! While PCs use pin 2 for RxD and pin 3 for TxD, modems normally
have those pins reversed! This allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2
to pin 2 etc. If you connect two PCs, cross RxD and TxD.
 
  If hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection
can be used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
	RxD1    to    TxD2
	TxD1    to    RxD2
Additionally, connect (if software needs it):
        RTS1    to    CTS1 & DCD1
	RTS2    to    CTS2 & DCD2
	DTR1    to    DSR1
	DTR2    to    DSR2
You won't need long wires for these!
  The null-modem connection is used to establish an XON/XOFF-transmission
between two PCs (see software section for details).
  Remember: the names DTR, DSR, CTS & RTS refer to the lines as seen from
the PC. This means that for your data set DTR & RTS are incoming signals
and DSR & CTS are outputs!

From what I've seen in coursework, most CPUs never actually
"idle".  They will continue to service interrupts, etc.,
etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter
what it's doing.

I suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use
circuitry which has more transistors than other
instructions, but if you consider the additional heat
generated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors
and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's
packaging, the change in temperature to the immediate
environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be
negligible.

I tried HyperDisk and various versions of SmartDRIVE, all to no avail.

Howdy,

I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro 286/12
with a Phoenix replacement BIOS, in order to support an IDE hard drive,
and a high-density 3.5" floppy.

I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure, but I have
encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit
responsibilty for, and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it.

Everything is hunky-dory except the 3.5" floppy, which will read, but NOT
WRITE diskettes.  Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs.

I have tried everything I can think of.

Any takers?

I have a floppy drive which has developed "General failure" errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5" drive).

I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.

However, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.

Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it.

Thanks!

I want to have some info about Diamond Stealth Pro / 2 MB VRAM:

  - what graphics modes does it support
  - are HI-COLOR modes included to VESA BIOS (for use with DOS programs)
  - any experiences yet (bugs & advantages)
  - how fast is it under Windows and DOS
  - price

Thanks...

I'm afriad that's not true.  The monitor problem seems to occur whenever
the 15" Mag monitor is put into 1024x768 mode.  I'm running OS/2 at 1024 and
the same symptoms appear.

It does not seem like a video card problem as the Cirrus Logic 5426 chip and
the ATI GUP seem to cause these problems... two VERY  different cards.

Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome
monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted
Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz
horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards
at boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their
own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to
send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've
studied it.

The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship
to reality.

Actually, the iAPX86 family has a HALT instruction that causes the CPU to
cease processing instructions.  The CPU resumes processing either by being
reset or by receiving an external (hardware) interrupt.  This is different
from the power management facilities Victor mentions.  Of course, whether an
operating system's idle loop uses the HALT instruction is another matter
entirely.

I have both!

I have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix box.

IDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk, SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it
has a SCSI hard disk, CD-ROM and tape.

I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier. For the price of one
irq and dma I have three different types of device connected up.

Faster drives are also available for SCSI - I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy
does have a 9ms average seek time. I.E it finds data 25% faster than my 12ms
Toshiba drive.

I don't think that SCSI will increase your data transfer much on an ISA bus :-(

890KB/s is pretty good...

Many state of the art SCSI disks use the *SAME* mechanicals as many state of the
art IDE drives. Only the interface electronis differ - look at the 520MB Fijitsu
drive for an example!

I use an Adaptec 1542B on my Unix box and no-name IDE cards on both.

Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does 
not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller! My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5MB/s! That's
faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain!

Which bus???

I think there are several reasons :-

50MHz motherboards are harder to get right
50MHz need a fast L2 cache - 12-15ns is a good idea
50MHz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant VESA bus
66MHz DX2 chips are faster for a lot of things


With a good, fast L2 cache a DX2/66 is going be be faster than a DX50...

What do I have?

A DX50 of course!

Does any one know what the PAS16 SCSI port is? I counted the pins on the board

I have two SCSI hard drives, each has 512KB of 'cache'.

There several reasons for this :-

When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be
busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and
the data can be transmitted.

When the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus
faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored
somewhere while the disk is writing it out.

In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache!

May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well...

Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be
some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use
the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it
is not possible to have both cards active at the same time.

Here is an example.  For some time, I was short of "free interrupts."  I had a
tape controller (not a "floppy tape") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an
*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my
modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and
the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt
handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate
an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape
controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would
most likely "hang.")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it
installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for
the serial port.

Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the
status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.
That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.
Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)

Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks

I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5" hard drive, model
LPS240A, and have a concern about its behavior.

Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to
file I/O, it performs what I call phantom seeks.

When the PC is absolutely idle, I can hear a spurt of activity in the
drive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to
be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never
comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card, not
the drive.]

My other hard disk, a Seagate ST3283A, does not have this kind
behavior.

Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon?

I have a 486/33 IBM clone with two serial ports (com1, com2) and mouse port.
Both the serial ports are directly sitting on the mother board.  I tried to
install a 2400 buad Hayes internal modem, but it doesnt work.  Once I dial any
number the system locks.  I do not hear any click or ring before it the system
hangs.  The modem has a 2 pin dip switch to select the appropriate port.  Once 
I change the settings on the dip switch, the system starts working again.

Then I bought a 2400 baud Hayes external modem and checked the system.  It
works fine with both the serial ports.  The internal modem has been checked on
another machine and it works fine, but does not work on my machine.

Can anyone please help me to find the problem.

No.  The Always IN-2000, among others requires no drivers for up to 7 SCSI

is done in hardware, there's no software drivers at all.

I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday
and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which
can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.

It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers.
The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours.
Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.

Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using
Hint chipsets.

Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.

Using ET4000/W32 drivers
640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.
        32k        7.34 
        64k        7.30
800x600 256       10.07

Using ET4000 drivers.
640x480 16M        1.78
800x600  16colours 4.01     
1kx786   16        4.22

From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the
hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are
just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card.

The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer.
It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it
which supports 256 colors on all resolution.

From these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card
in 256 colours mode.

A couple other problems with the 486DX/50:

1.)  System manufacturers had MAJOR problems solving the electromagnetic 
interference problems with 486DX/50 systems.  Getting an FCC-B (home use) 
certification required additional shielding in the system.

2.)  HEAT...a lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks and/or cooling 
fans on their 486DX2/66 chips.  I would guess that the 486DX/50 ran 
temperatures inside the case even hotter.  And heat is the enemy of system 
reliability.

Do you mean the ViewSonic 7?  It uses a Matsushita tube.  The Computer

It was the lowest priced monitor in the test,  and did have good center

The 50 MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. Most
of the DX-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectively
DX2-50:s. Also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards are
better off at 33 MHz bus speed. The 8k internal cache allows the
DX2-66 to be generally faster anyway.

Les,

	I am right now working on an MPR-II certified (Swedish standards for
low emissions) Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor.  It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at
that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)
issue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in
image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any
difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one
of the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's
Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.
But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a
bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim "low
emissions" but not specifically "MPR-II Compliant" or "MPR-II Certified"
only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.
	So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-
tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low
emissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you
may be more discerning.  Good luck!

I just ordered my 4DX2-66V system from Gateway.  Thanks for all the net
discussions which helped me decide among all the vendors and options.

Right now, the 4DX2-66V system includes 16MB of RAM.  The 8MB upgrade
used to cost an additional $340.

Nanao's F-Series (e.g. F550i) and T-Series (e.g. T660i) monitors
are MPR-II compliant.  According to my little pamphlet, the T-Series
monitors are also TCO-compliant, whatever that is.

Due to the large amount of request for 3dbench of ET4000/W32,
I finally can get a 3dbench v1.0 from a ftp site.

The 3dbench of ET4000/W32 in my Cardex W32 card with 1MB DRAM
has superscape benchmark of 26.3 frames/sec.

Hope it will satisfy people curiosity of this ET4000/W32 performance.
What other benchmark program result you would want to know? 8-)

I have a Nanao 17" (F560?)  on my IPX. I prefer it to my Sun 16"
trinitron at work with all those vertical jitters and the two
horizontal shadowmask thingies.

I got it from one of the folks advertising in Computer Shopper et al
for $1050 plus about $40 shipping. 

I bought a cable which goes from the Sun's 13W3 connector to the
monitors 4xRGBS for about $50 from a Macintosh mailorder shop (Relax
Technologies).

I'd do it again. Happily.

I've posted a couple of notes about encountering this problem. Based on some 
suggestions from:

Mark Aitchison, University of Canterbury, New Zealand.
	and
Chris A. Larrieu @cs.wm.edu

I think that my problem is a screen saver that also outputs sound (to my 
PC speaker). I'm still looking at some of the other screen savers that I 
use (with a randomizer), but this one definately caused the loss of several 
minutes over night (but not the date this time).

This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers,
and users alike.  COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM
port, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just
searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The
first equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by
the rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set
of "standard" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the
order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for
serial ports.

So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were
this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS
to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the
field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that
there are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly, I don't know of a simgle
program that would actually have a problem with this.)

I have a 105MB IDE drive and am having a few problems! I get 
'Data error on drive C' messages when reading some files. The problem is
also steadily getting worse.

I have run some diagnostic software (PCTools V7.1) and it says that the
drive is OK - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly 
flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read).

Does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these
sectors as bad (DOS doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format.
I have heard that the latter is possible on an IDE. Technical answers
would be appreciated. It would be nice to be able to use the disk again!!!

I am running MS-DOS 5 on an AT clone.

I have a PC Power and cooling fan and it is a heat sink with a built in fan 
that glues on top of the CPU.  Even if the fan quits you still have the heat 
sink fins to aid cooling.  The glue, of course, is the type that has high 
thermal conductivity.

I originally posted a complaint about how noisy my PC was. I got several 
useful suggestions, but 1 was the most seductive: run your PC in silence by 
removing the fan altogether!

Two variables: 
1) I always run my PC without the cover, and 
2) I'd be willing to attach a CPU cooler if that would make a difference.

Should I try to run my PC without a fan? I know it sounds like utter folly so 
I'm asking - has anyone done this succesfully? Or tragically? You're answer 
may save my PC... Thanks.

I have a 286 with a Western Digital WD-93044A hard drive. This drive is 
782 cylinders with 4 read write heads PHYSICALLY, but LOGICALLY it is
977 cylinders with 5 read write heads (??!!).  In the CMOS setting
I am instructed to set it to type 17 (IBM 977 cyl. 5 read/write heads),

THE PROBLEM:  I was sent Western Digitals ISPFMT low level program from
the manufacturer, and was instructed to run it on the hard drive with
the CMOS setting set to type 17.  This worked "o.k." and I verified the
disk using the same program.  I then reloaded DOS which did a high
level format, again no errors, no bad sectors, etc.

BUT.... when I run Norton Speedisk 6.01 (or any other disk optimizer)
with the verify option set ON, I get ERROR verifying sector NNNN,
where NNNN can be any number (not the same all the time).

ANY IDEAS AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WOULD BE APPRECIATED!

I have a 486 DX 33 motherboard in my pc that i'd like to speed up. 
I'd rather not replace the whole motherboard, instead i'd like to know
if i can use a DX/2 66Mhz cpu. The BIOS is late model AMI, circa 1991,
and the system crystal is approx 66.3Mhz. 

My question is, can i just replace the original 33MHz cpu with the new
DX/2 cpu? If its possible, will there be a need for extra cooling
devices such as heatsinks and / or muffin fans??
